# Stop sign detector
This is an implementation of a CNN based on RasNet18 in Pytorch to recognize Stop signs.

Prolem is for `IBM`.

## Description
You have been employed as a Junior Data Scientist by Jokwu, a self-driving car start-up in Capetown, South Africa. Jokwu has created the hardware and parts of the car, and they are beginning to create sensors; the next step is to have a working model that identifies traffic signs. The project and product team have decided to start with stop signs - is it a stop sign or not?

As a first step, you have been given a dataset and tasked with training a model that identifies the stop signs in an image. This will be integrated into a motion detector as a next step.

#### Tasks
* Task 1: Gather and Upload Your Data

* Task 2: Train Your Classifier

* Task 3: Deploy Your Model

* Task 4: Test Your Classifier

## Datasets

There are two bunch of images:
* <a href="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CV0101EN-Coursera/dataset/stop.zip">Stop</a>
* <a href="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CV0101EN-Coursera/dataset/not_stop.zip">Non stop</a>

## Deploy
Also I deployed this model on `IBM cloud` which you can access it using <a href="https://stop-sign-detector-610ebf9459083bb6a43c3b62.cw25hygqnp3.eu-gb.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/">this link</a>.
